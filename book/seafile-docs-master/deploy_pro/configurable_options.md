### <a id="wiki-options-you-may-want-to-modify"></a>Options you may want to modify

The section above listed all the options in `/data/haiwen/pro-data/seafevents.conf`. Most of the time you can use the default settings. But you may want to modify some of them to fit your own use case. 

We list them in the following table, as well as why we choose the default value.

<table>
<tr>
<th>section</th>
<th>option</th>

<tr>
<td>INDEX FILES</td>
<td>index_office_pdf</td>
<td>false</td>
<td>
The full text search of office/pdf documents is not enabled by default. This is because it may consume quite some space for the search index. To turn it on, set this value to "true" and recreate the search index. See the [FAQ For Seafile Professional Server](faq_for_seafile_pro_server.md) for detail.
