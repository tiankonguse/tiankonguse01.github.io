        ClearSilver
    </b>
    is a fast, powerful, and language-neutral template system. It is designed
    to make it easy to create template driven static or dynamic websites.
    <p>
        ClearSilver is first and foremost designed to be extremely fast. It is
        coded completely in C and exported to your script language of choice (i.e.
        Python, Perl). As a result, it is notably faster than template systems
        written in a script language. However, its design has additional benefits.
        It is also one of the only template systems available which allows you
        to easily mix-and-match multiple programming languages with the same templates,
        even on the same page. This allows you to optimize your website by writing
        C-modules to handle speed-sensitive sections, while leaving the majority
        of your site in easy to write script code.
