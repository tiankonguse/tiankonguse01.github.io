## 1. Content is Important


> If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them   
> – George Orwell  

It’s like good storytelling – your writing needs to guide your audience into what you want them to think/perceive or they will create a picture on their own which might not be necessarily what you originally wanted.  


## 2. Read Well


> If you don’t have the time to read, you don’t have the time or the tools to write   
> – Stephen King  


The more you read, the more ideas gets generated in your mind and you should also focus on reading from the competition to know what they are writing so that you can find a way to stand out from the crowd.  


## 3. Eliminate the Unnecessary

> The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak   
> - Hans Hoffman  


> My most important piece of advice to all you would-be writers: when you write, try to leave out all the parts readers skip   
> – Elmore Leonard  

> A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts   
> – William Strunk Jr.  


Don’t just write for the sake of filling up, eliminate whatever you think will bore your audience.  

## 4. Be Passionate

> This is the challenge of writing. You have to be very emotionally engaged in what you’re doing, or it comes out flat. You can’t fake your way through this   
> – Gordon Atkinson  


You should write on a topic you are passionate about as unless you are excited about what you are writing how you can expect the reader to be thrilled while reading.  

## 5. Paint a Picture

> The skill of writing is to create a context in which other people can think   
> – Edwin Schlossberg  

To create a powerful emotional response your writing needs to spark the same thoughts in your reader’s mind as with which you started writing in the first place. So don’t just simply state.  

## 6. Use Images & Typography

> Typos are very important to all written form. It gives the reader something to look for so they aren’t distracted by the total lack of content in your writing  
> – Randy K. Milholland  

> Ideas are refined and multiplied in the commerce of minds. In their splendor, images affect a very simple communion of souls  
> – Gaston Bachelard  

Visual sometimes better expresses the writing or at least complements it. So it’s advisable to use images and good typography.  

## 7. KISS (Keep it Short & Simple)

> Vigorous writing is concise  
> – William Strunk Jr.  

> The finest language is mostly made up of simple unimposing words  
> – George Eliot  

Simple words are more easily understood and communicate your thoughts better. So use simple words and write only what is necessary to communicate to the audience.  

## 8. Accept Criticism

> Don’t mind criticism. If it is untrue, disregard it; if unfair, keep from irritation; if it is ignorant, smile; if it is justified it is not criticism, learn from it  
> – Unknown Author  

Pay attention to what others had to comment and learn from it and if you are just starting then again try to gasp from other successful writings (similar) and know why their audience (perhaps the same as yours) appreciated it and what they liked about it.  

## 9. Keep Writing

> Quantity produces quality. If you only write a few things, you’re doomed  
> – Ray BradburyYour  

How true – the more you write the better you become.  

## 10. Be Unique & Unpredictable

> Consistency requires you to be as ignorant today as you were a year ago  
> – Bernard Berenson  

> Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative  
> – Oscar Wilde  

Experiment and be creative and your audience will like you more.  

## 11. To Sum it up

> Make it simple. Make it memorable. Make it inviting to look at. Make it fun to read  
> – Leo Burnett
